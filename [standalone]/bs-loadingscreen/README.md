## 📦 Exports & Events


The loading screen can be shut down automatically or manually from another resource:

### 🔄 Automatic Shutdown

Set in your server.cfg:
```
setr loadingscreen:externalShutdown false
```

With this setting, the loading screen will automatically shut down after loading is complete.

### 🛑 Manual/External Shutdown

Set in your server.cfg:
```
setr loadingscreen:externalShutdown true
```

With this setting, you need to trigger the shutdown from another resource. The resource provides a simple export to do this:

```lua
-- In your character selection or spawn script
exports['bs-loadingscreen']:shutdownLoadingScreen()
```
Use this in client-side scripts to manually hide the loading screen if needed.

#### 👤 Example Integration with Character Selection
This approach gives you precise control over when the loading screen disappears, making it perfect for character selection screens or other custom spawn systems.

```lua
-- In your character selection script
CharacterSelect = function()
    DoScreenFadeOut(300)
    
    -- Shutdown the loading screen before showing character selection
    exports['bs-loadingscreen']:shutdownLoadingScreen()
    
    -- Continue with character selection setup
    -- ...
end
```

## 💡 Tips & Known Issues

- Large video files may delay screen load – optimize or compress video
- Use `.ogg` or `.mp3` audio formats for best browser compatibility
- The script doesn’t block connection – it’s purely visual
- YouTube overlay (Title) may be visible for a short time during loading

### 🖼️ Changing Background
- For video: Place MP4 files in `html/assets/video/` and update config
- For image: Place image files in `html/assets/img/` and update config
- For YouTube: Set `backgroundType` to "youtube" and provide a `YouTubeID`
- For Slideshow: Set `backgroundType` to "slideshow" and provide a `backgroundImages` array

### 🎵 Adding Music
1. Place MP3 files in `html/assets/music/`
2. Add entries to the `musicList` in config.js
